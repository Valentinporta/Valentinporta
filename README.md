I was presented to the amazing world of IT during the first year of COVID and have fallen in love with web development ever since. I started off self taught and ended up attending a Fullstack Bootcamp called HENRY in which I learned the PERN Stack, PostgreSQL - ExpressJs - React Js - Node Js and i'm currently a Teaching Assistant there for the new students that aspire to become developers!

Skills: JavaScript / TypeScript / React / Redux / Html / Css / Node / Express / Sequelize / Bootstrap

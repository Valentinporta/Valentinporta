I was presented to the amazing world of IT during the first year of COVID and have fallen in love with web development ever since. I started off self taught and ended up attending a Fullstack Bootcamp called HENRY in which I learned the PERN Stack, PostgreSQL - ExpressJs - React Js - Node Js and i'm currently a Teaching Assistant there for the new students that aspire to become developers!

I'm really glad I gave programming a chance because I really enjoy waking up every day and coding for hours on end, it's something I love to do on a daily basis, even in my free time and weekends!

Skills: JavaScript / TypeScript / React / Redux / Html / Css / Node / Express / Sequelize / Bootstrap

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project for a Start Up called Mist in which the team and I are using tech such as TypeScript, Firebase, React and RxJS 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to implement Typescript with React and also how to use Firebase!
